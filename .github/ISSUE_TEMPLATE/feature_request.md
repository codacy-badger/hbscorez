I'm always frustrated when...

Consider following points:
- [ ] what are you trying to accomplish?
- [ ] which feature did you miss?
- [ ] how has this affected you?
- [ ] alternatives you've considered*
- [ ] screenshots*
- [ ] requester status*: user, developer
- [ ] version used* (e.g. website, local copy at commit X)
- [ ] browser* (e.g. Chrome 68, Firefox 61, Safari 11):
- [ ] OS* (e.g. Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04, Android 8.0, iOS 11.4.1):
- [ ] ideas how to implement the addition or change (consider creating a PULL REQUEST)
